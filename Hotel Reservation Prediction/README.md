# Hotel Reservation Prediction (MLOps Project)

## Overview
This project predicts whether a hotel reservation will be canceled or not-canceled, helping hotels optimize resource allocation and reduce revenue loss.  
It implements an end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** with automation, experiment tracking, and cloud deployment.

## Features
- End-to-End ML pipeline (data preprocessing → training → deployment)  
- Experiment tracking with **MLflow**  
- CI/CD automation using **Jenkins**  
- Deployment on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  
- **Dockerized** for portability and reproducibility  
- Automated retraining and monitoring  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, Flask
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib  
- **MLOps Tools:** MLflow, Jenkins, Docker  
- **Cloud:** GCP   
- **Version Control & CI:** Git, GitHub

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaning, encoding, scaling  
2. **Model Training & Tracking** – MLflow logs metrics/artifacts  
3. **CI/CD with Jenkins** – automated train/test/deploy pipeline  
4. **Deployment on GCP** – model served as REST API in Docker container  
5. **Monitoring** – model versions tracked in MLflow
