### Gun Object Detection using MLOps and FastAPI

This project is a **Gun Object Detection System** built using **Deep Learning**, following proper **MLOps practices**.  
The model is served through a **FastAPI backend** for real-time image inference.

---

#### Project Overview

The system detects guns in images using **Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50 FPN backbone)**, a pre-trained model from PyTorchâ€™s `torchvision.models.detection`.  
It is an end-to-end **MLOps-integrated workflow**, including data versioning, experiment tracking, model deployment, and CI/CD.
